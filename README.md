## Functionality

There are two principal functionalities in this app

- Playing tic tac toe with a server side algorithm that is the AI
  - /api/matches has a PUT method that creates a match in the first player movement, then it updates that match with the created match id.
  - It has an algorithm that generates the movement by AI.
  - It checks if the player has won and after generating a new movement it checks again if that new movement has won the match
- See the classification
  - /api/matches/classification has a GET method that retrieves all matches and calculates how many victories has each player and how many draws.
